# AI Edit Notes

## Inline Edits

- Good for: Tight refactors in VoteForm (submit state, UX tweaks).
- Less good for: Creating new files/routing—context too narrow.

## Chat Edits

- Good for: Scaffolding /polls/[id], not-found, and index page at once; passing props.
- Less good for: Small internal tweaks; sometimes over-edits styles.

## Prompts used

- Inline: “Add disabled state…”, “Refactor to useTransition…”
- Chat: “Create dynamic route…”, “List polls and link to details…”
